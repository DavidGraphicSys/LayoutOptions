# LayoutOptions

####**Overview**
This is collection of simple layout changes for newly created Four51 2.0 apps.  Each one is designed to be implemented on a newly created app before any other changes are made.   Attempting to use these file overrides on an existing app may have unforeseen consequences.

####**Tips**

 - Nearly all layout options include a README.md file and all source files. The README provides step-by-step instructions for implementation.
 - You can access the raw code by opening the source file and clicking the “Raw” button in the upper right corner.
 - Capitalization counts. Be aware that you are referencing files throughout the code, and some words/titles/files need to be named or referenced exactly.  Double check your spelling and capitalization if the solution doesn't seem to be working.
